# Blog plan

## Initial setup

Using default themes, set up a blog and add a couple of posts. Add images and pages.

Then discuss that, to go further, we need to pick a theme and some of our decisions (and Markdown syntax) will be determined by the theme we choose.


## Themes
maybe save themes for a separate post because there are three ways to set up themes

1. Use the instructions in pelican-themes, where you use Git to copy the entire repo and point your config file to a specific folder
2. Use `pelican-themes --install` to copy files to a theme folder in your virtuakl environment
3. Manually ciopy theme file to a folder in the blog project (the folder is named "themes") and point to it in your config file
  * I think the last option is best because, if you choose to modify the theme files, any changes you make are tracked in your own source control system. 
  * You can also use themes that are not part of the pelican-themes project



# Create a static web site with Pelican and Python

[Pelican](https://getpelican.com/)

There is a [great tutorial about using Pelican](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html) at the Full Stack Python blog.

## Install Pelican



Create a directory for your web site and create a virtual environment

```bash
$ mkdir my_web_site
$ cd my_web_site
$ pythons -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $
```

Install Pelican with the Markdown [extras](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46775346/what-do-square-brackets-mean-in-pip-install) enabled:

```bash
(env) $ pip install "pelican[markdown]"
```

## Initialize web site project

```bash
(env) $ pelican-quickstart
```

This script asks some questions and uses your answers to populate the configuration files. I already registered a URL for my web site so I answered "yes" when asked if I want to specify a URL prefix.  I found the correct responses to the question about time zones can be found in the [Wikipedia list of standard time zones](ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). I will deploy my website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)(https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/) via a [GitHub integration](https://codelapan.com/post/how-to-upload-or-deploy-static-website-on-netlify) so I do not need to use Pelican to upload files so I answered "no" to the question asking me if I wanted to create a Makefile to automate publishing.

```bash
Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.8.0.

This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
needed by Pelican.
    
> Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] 
> What will be the title of this web site? Learning with Code
> Who will be the author of this web site? Brian Linkletter
> What will be the default language of this web site? [en] 
> Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., https://example.com   (Y/n) y
> What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) https://learnwithcode.com
> Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) y
> How many articles per page do you want? [10] 
> What is your time zone? [Europe/Rome] America/Toronto
> Do you want to generate a tasks.py/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) n
Done. Your new project is available at /home/brian/Projects/python-web-site
```

You can go back and edit the Pelican configuration file later if you need to change any settings. For example, I will have to update the configuration files when I decide the service to which I will upload my web site.

If you look at the directory, you will see that the *pelican-quickstart* script created some new directories and configuration files.

```python
(env) $ ls
content  env   output  pelicanconf.py  publishconf.py 
```

The *content* directory will contain the blog posts. Each post will be a single markdown file. The *pelicanconf.py* and *publishconf.py* arte python scripts that generate configuration information. The *output* file will contain the files generated by Pelican that create the static website. Currently, it is empty.


### Quick test

Create a dummy blog post in the *content* directory to quickly check that the site is working

```bash
(env) $ cd content
(env) $ nano use-environment-variables-python.md
```

```
title: Use environment variables to protect your secrets
slug: use-environment-variables-python
date: 2023-06-07
modified: 2023-06-07

Environment variables are key-value pairs that are are set outside of a Python program but may be accessed by the program during its execution.

# Why use environment variables

There are many reasons to use environment variables instead of just hard-coding program configuration information in your program's source code:

1. Security

   Normally, you do not want to reveal sensitive information like passwords, database credentials, or API keys to anyone who looks at your code. 

# Conclusion

This was a test created by copying content from one of my posts
```

```bash
(env) $ pelican
[22:40:11] WARNING  Watched path does not exist:                       log.py:91
                    /home/brian/Projects/python-web-site/content/image          
                    s                                                           
Done: Processed 1 article, 0 drafts, 0 hidden articles, 0 pages, 0 hidden pages 
and 0 draft pages in 0.09 seconds.
```

```bash
(env) $ pelican --listen
```

You see that the blog shows one post. 

![](./images/blog_test.png)

Hit CTRL-C to stop the server.

Now capture the image of the blog and save it in a new directory named *images* and put the screen capture in there. then add it to the blog post.

# Themes

Next, pick a theme for the blog. The default theme looks OK but bloggers like to customize the blog.

Some themes I like are:

* [*Flex* theme](https://flex.alxd.me/)
  * Simple to set up and looks good
  * Mobile-first theme
  * Author can configure dark or light mode
  * Supports many plugins

* [*Papyrus* theme](https://aleylara.github.io/Papyrus/)
  * Supports viewer-configurable dark and light mode
  * Supports many plugins
  * Allows author to create summaries of posts on main page
  * Looks good on mobile, also

Use the [pelican-themes](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/pelican-themes.html) command

First, see which themes already exit on your system:

```bash
pelican-themes --list
```
```
notmyidea
simple
```

The default theme is *notmyidea*.

To change themes, add a "THEME" line to the *pelicanconf.py* file. Add the following line to the end of the file:

```
THEME = 'simple'
```

Then run pelican again

```bash
(env) $ pelican
(env) $ pelican --listen
```

You see the them changed to the *simple* theme.

![](./images/theme_test.png)

You can only switch to themes that are installed. To isnatll a theme, copy the theme files to a folder on your PC, usually to the *Downloads* folder. Then use the *pelican-themes* command to copy the theme files to the correct location on your system which is, by default, in your Python virtual environment.

A good place to look for themes is the [Pelican Themes repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) on GitHub.

install the "Flex" theme

get v2.5 of the flex theme files

https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/releases/tag/v2.5.0

and store the archive on your PC in the Downloads folder

uncompress the file so all the files are installed in a directory named Flex-2.5.0

```
(env) $ cd ~/Downloads
(env) $ wget https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/archive/refs/tags/v2.5.0.zip
(env) $ unzip v2.5.0.zip
```

Use *pelican-themes* to copy the files to the correct location

```
(env) $ pelican-themes --install ~/Downloads/Flex-2.5.0/
```

See that the new theme is installed

```
(env) $ pelican-themes --list
Flex-2.5.0
notmyidea
simple
```

See the locations the themes are installed

```
(env) $ pelican-themes --list -v
```

```
/home/brian/Projects/python-web-site/env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pelican/themes/notmyidea
/home/brian/Projects/python-web-site/env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pelican/themes/simple
/home/brian/Projects/python-web-site/env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pelican/themes/Flex-2.5.0
```

You may delete the downloaded files if you want to save some space. They are not needed anymore

```
(env) $ rm v2.5.0.zip
(env) $ rm -r Flex-2.5.0
```


Now switch to the Flex theme:

Edit the following line in *pelicanconf.py*

```
THEME = 'Flex-2.5.0'
```

Then run pelican again

```bash
(env) $ pelican
(env) $ pelican --listen
```

When starting a Pelican-based blog, you will probably want to install multiple themes so you can experiment with the way your site looks,

Look at customization options for Flex them

You need to add more to the pelicanconf.py file to get a more fine-tunes look
